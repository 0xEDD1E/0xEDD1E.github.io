Hello, I'm 0xEDD1E. I'm a programming enthusiast. Currently I'm learning programming. I think writing a blog and sharing my projects will help me to practice programming. So I write blogs to share my programming works, however they may be not very good codes. So please be kind to give me your suggestions about my works. I always appreciate it. :grin:  
You can find me at {% include icon-github.html username="0xedd1e" %}

Blog theme : *jekyll-new*  
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /

This blog is powered by *Jekyll*
